# Week 10 Lab

Over the past week, you and your classmates have learned a ton about:

- Backbone
  - Models, Views, and Collections
- Sass
- Flexbox
- Map APIs
- jQuery Plugins
- Pseudo Classes and Elements

Given your new front-end expertise, we'd like you to revisit Project 1, and build
a single page application that persists data.

**Please Note**, this is your chance to get more practice with the topics
we covered this week. We are **not** expecting a finished product. Please take
this opportunity to experiment with the material and learn from classmates
in the other track.

Please break up into groups of 4 or 5 (2 or 3 from each track), and tackle one of the following prompts:

- [Concentration](https://github.com/ga-dc/pbj-project1#concentration)
- [Trivia](https://github.com/ga-dc/pbj-project1#self-scoring-trivia)
- [Flash Cards](https://github.com/ga-dc/pbj-project1#flash-cards)

**Feeling adventurous?**

- [Connect 4](http://www.knowledgeadventure.com/games/connect-four/)


## Requirements

Your application must persist data. You are welcome to use either Rails or Express
on your back end, but please include some way to revisit a game after the user
leaves and/or save a high score / compare with others. This may or may not require
a User model and/or User authentication via a third party API.
